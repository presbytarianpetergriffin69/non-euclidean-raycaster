# non-euclidean-raycaster
A clone of my raycaster demo featuring spherical geometry

I wrote this as an update to my original raycaster, not wanting to modify it as it is so I rewrote a new one that is mostly similar except for the peculiar way rays are cast.
Here, rays are cast in a spherical motion, causing walls to appear in a spherical way. This is obviously different from my original vision and not useful in any practical game.
